About Hamiltonians and Schrodinger:

Schrodinger's Wave Equation can be solved using linear operators, such as Hamiltonian. By applying the operator, one can obtain
a solution to an eigenvalue problem and obtain ground state energy.

General Methodology:

Utilization of a basis set is used in solving Schrodinger equation. The process requires a Hamiltonian operator and an initial
set of user defined coefficicent, which includes complex numbers.

Executing the Code:

The program can be ran using IDE such as Visual Studio 2015. The program coomes with Math.NET package used to linear algebra programs.
User can input desired parameters such as choice of function and size of basis set. Additional paremeters can be defined, including 
constants such as c, V_0 and Period. These parameters can be directly modified inside the code.


TO DO:

-Full use of complex numbers, primarily i
-Use Legendre and Fourier with domain component, not just coefficients
